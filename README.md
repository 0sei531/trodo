# TRODO Project

## Overview
Trodo is a 3D raycasting game written in C. The goal is to recreate a simplified version of Wolfenstein 3D. The project uses the **SDL2** library for graphics rendering and input handling.

## Requirements

- **SDL2** library: You will need to install SDL2 and **SDL_image** for loading and displaying images.
- C compiler (e.g., GCC).
- Make or another build tool (optional).

### Installing Dependencies

1. **SDL2**:
   - On Ubuntu/Debian-based systems, use:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
     ```
   - On macOS, use Homebrew:
     ```bash
     brew install sdl2
     ```

2. **SDL2_image** (for image loading):
   - On Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
     ```

   - On macOS:
     ```bash
     brew install sdl2_image
     ```

3. **Other dependencies** (if applicable):
   - If you are using additional libraries like **SDL2_ttf**, follow similar steps to install them using your package manager.
